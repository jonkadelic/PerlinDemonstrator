# PerlinDemonstrator

A tool designed to allow 2D Perlin noise generation for Minecraft to be easily previewed and tweaked. The pane on the left can have C# code written in it and executed using the Execute button. Hitting Ctrl+S will save the buffer so that it is preserved between restarts.

The Perlin generator provided is NoiseGeneratorOctaves, a port of the noise generator from Minecraft Alpha 1.1.2_01 into C#.
